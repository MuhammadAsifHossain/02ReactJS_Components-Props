# ReactJS components and props

This repository contains a simple React code example demonstrating the concept of components, props, and default exports

## **Overview:**
* The **ParentComp** component in **App.js** passes props to the **ChildComp** component.
* The **ChildComp** component in **ChildComp.js** receives props and displays them.
* Only _default exports_ have been used throughout the application.
* Image props are also utilized in the components.
